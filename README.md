Welcome to the **WelcomeKit** repository! This project consists of a two-part application designed to help users manage and view content easily. The **Welcome Kit** viewer provides a user-friendly interface for displaying information, while the **Generator** tool allows for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage that content. Both components are built using vanilla JavaScript, ensuring a lightweight and efficient experience.
